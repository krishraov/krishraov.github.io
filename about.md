Hi there and welcome to "Coding Problems" - a place where I have collected a whole lot of questions that appear in coding / programming interviews. Why have I created this site? Well, mainly to serve as a repository for the questions that I came across while studying for coding interviews. I am primarily an electrical engineer with a lot of experience in image/video, but I lack the skills in cracking "coding interviews". I, like most people that I have talked to, have never used binary trees in my day-job, but they form an important part of computer science theory and have their needs - whether I like it or not. 

Hence, I decided to put my head down and start studying algorithms, data structures to enrich my knowledge and grow out of my shell of being only an "double EE graduate with good C programming skills".

I also decided to learn Python and consequently decided to prepare for coding interviews in Python. It is suprisingly easy to express myself in Python and I am enjoying it! 

Again, I'd like iterate that by no means are the solutions here the "best-ever, 5-start, rock-start" solutions. They are the answers I came up with and I have recorded them here for my reference and understanding. 

However, if you have a better solution to a problem, please do let me know in the comments. I will be grateful to you for sharing your knowledge :) 

Have a great day!
